# ClueChain: A Bayesian Network-Based Mystery Solver Application

## Overview

**ClueChain** is a mystery solver application that uses Bayesian networks to solve fictional mystery scenarios. The application allows users to input various clues and evidence related to a crime and then applies Bayesian inference to calculate the probabilities of different suspects being guilty. The system provides an interactive and data-driven way to deduce the most likely suspect based on the provided evidence.

## Features

- **Clue Input**: Users can provide various clues or pieces of evidence that may relate to the crime.
- **Bayesian Inference**: The system applies Bayesian networks to calculate the likelihood of suspects being guilty based on inputted clues.
- **Interactive UI**: The application provides an easy-to-use interface for adding clues, viewing results, and understanding the logic behind the probability calculations.
- **Mystery Scenarios**: The app can be used for various fictional mystery scenarios, making it adaptable to a variety of situations.
   ```

## Usage

To run the project, execute the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

You will be prompted to enter clues and evidence for the mystery, and the application will use Bayesian inference to calculate and display the probability of different suspects.
